    <h2> Why was this website created? </h2>
    <p> This website was built in April 2020 during the COVID pandemic. The amount of misinformation, the mass panic, the rising death toll, and the sensationalization via media headlines resulted in a perfect storm of misinformation, hysteria, and general mistrust of the people in power and the information they espoused. Incorrect information was promulgated by domestic and international leadership, the media, and by family and friends via social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter. What resulted was a general confusion over the basic facts regarding the pandemic, treatments, vaccines, masks, quarantine, the economy, and unemployment. What was lacking was a platform where factual information could be received without the sensationalization of the media. What was lacking was a source of information that was easy for the general public to understand. What was lacking was a place where the basic truths could be learned without political commentators and social media influencers spinning each new piece of information for their own personal or political gain. And thus, this website was created.</p>
    <h2> What is the purpose of this website? </h2>
    <p>The goal of this site is to pierce through that torrent of misinformation bombarding the general public and provide to them basic facts, devoid of political spin, sensationalization, and unsourced information. This is a website for all people regardless of political affiliation to come to and receive unbiased information. While this website will still contain opinions, suggestions, and remarks of the author, these will be <em> clearly demarcated </em> in order to minimize the conflation of the author's opinions with the facts. In essence, we are hoping that this site is able to "Bridge the Gap" between the public and truthful information.</p>
    <h2> What is <em> not </em> the purpose of this website? </h2>
    <p> This website is not intended to give medical or personal advice. This website is not intended to critique political parties. While the opinions of the author will be included in this website, these will be clearly demarcated; however, he hopes that his commentary will be apolitical. </p> <hr />
