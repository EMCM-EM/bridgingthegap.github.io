								<ul>
									<li>Major risk to transmission is close proximity to people (&lt; 6ft) or prolonged contact with infected person (&ge; 15 minutes)</li>
									<li class="bold"> Transmission can occur when in contact with asymptomatic individuals</li>
								</ul>

								<ul>
									<h4>Life of SARS-CoV-2 on different materials</h4>
									<li>Cardboard: 24 hours</li>
									<li>Copper: 4 hours</li>
									<li>Plastic: ~72 hours</li>
									<li>Stainless Steel: ~48 hours</li>
								</ul>
						</ul>
					<h3> How can catching and transmitting covid-19 be prevented?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Frequent handwashing with Soap and Water</li>
						<li>Try not to touch your face, nose, eyes, and mouth as much as possible. If you do touch, wash your hands.</li>
						<li>Wear a mask when in public.</li>
						<li>Keep a 6ft distance between people when in public.</li>
						<li>Stay at home in self-quarantine unless absolutely essential.</li>
						<li>Cover mouth and nose when coughing and/or sneezing. </li>

					</ul>
					<h3> Should I get tested? </h3>
						<ul>
							<li> People who have no symptoms of COVID-19 generally do not need testing. However, there are exceptions and your personal risk level depends on multiple factors. </li>
							<li> Here is a survey to see your personal risk and whether to get tested: <a href="https://mn.gov/covid19/for-minnesotans/if-sick/get-tested/index.jsp"> Should I Get Tested? </a> </li>

			<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-12 opinions"> <!-- Opinions -->
					<h1> Editorial </h1>
					<h3> Is covid caused by a bacteria?</h3>
					<p> No, covid-19 is a virus. There are 5 main categories of infections: viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths. For each categories treatment varies. Antibacterials (Antibiotics) are meant to target bacteria and only bacteria. Since covid-19 is a virus, antibacterials (antibiotics) will not treat covid-19.</p>
					<h3>Why should I wear a mask if I don't have any symptoms?</h3>
					<p> You only need to wear a mask when you are around people that are not a part of your household. Even if you aren't showing symptoms, it is possible you are an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. So to minimize the spread as much as possible, wearing a mask is important. Plus, it will help minimize your likelihood of getting covid from a stranger who may be an asymptomatic (or a symptomatic) carrier.</p>
					<h3> Can wearing a mask lead to carbon dioxide poisoning? </h3>
					<p> Wearing a mask can be uncomfortable. It can get hot and claustrophobic inside. However, wearing a mask does not increase your risk of carbon dioxide poisoning. The pores of most masks are big enought to let carbon dioxide out and oxygen in. However, a virus like coronavirus is much bigger than a molecule of oxygen or carbon dioxide. Therefore, many masks are capable of keeping out (or in) the virus. </p>
					<h3> What if I have to cough while wearing a mask? </h3>
					<p> Cough straight into the mask while looking forward. Do not turn your head while coughing because that can allow the virus to travel out of the mask from the side. Coughing straight into the mask without turning your head will minimize leakage. </p>
					<h3>Is Covid-19 caused by 5G?</h3>
					<p>No. I think the confusion arises from the fact that both Covid-19 and 5G are invisible to the eye. Covid-19 is an organism - specifically a virus. 5G, on the other hand, is a wave (like light, radio, infrared, etc.) but of a very high frequency - known as a millimeter wave.</p>
					<h3> Are ventillators death sentences?</h3>
					<p> Ventillators are vital tools that allow a machine to takeover and control the respiratory cycle of a patient when the patient is unable to do so independently. Only the sickest patients are placed on a ventillator - patients who are very likely to die without the ventillator. Therefore, ventillators actually save lives by reducing the mortality rate. </p>
					<h3> Can injecting/drinking disinfectant help cure covid?</h3>
					<p> No. Doing so could be fatal or cause significant injury.</p>
					<h3> Will gargling with salt water/lemon water/tonics/hot water etc. help prevent covid?</h3>
					<p> Covid actually invades your cells in order to replicate. Salt Water/Lemon Water/Hot Water does not kill the cells lining your respiratory tract and/or gasterointestinal tract. Therefore, gargling with these liquids will not prevent covid. Plus, there are many cells that covid invades all at once, it would be imposible to kill all these cells with gargling. This is the same reason why it's not possible to cure the flu with gargling. However, if gargling with salt water/hot water/lemon water makes you feel better, go for it! </p>
					<h3> If I get covid once will I get it again? </h3>
					<p> In short, it is too early to tell at the moment. It is possible that full recovery from covid will gain you some immunity against catching the virus again. But, more studies need to be done to understand this. Even if you gain immunity, we do not know for how long - whether its immunity for weeks or for months or for years. We do not know if only certain people gain immunity, if all patients gain immunity, or if no patients gain immunity. The idea of "herd immunity" requires that most members of a population catch the virus and gain immunity...but if the "gaining immunity" step never occurs, we will just be spreading the virus back and forth between people. A vaccine on the other hand is an attempt to force the body's immune system to recognize some portion of the covid virus and mount an immune response to eliminate the virus as soon as it enters the body. </p>
					<h3> When will a vaccine be available? Will it be available? </h3>
					<p> We do not know the answer to both these questions yet. Many pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions are working hard to create a vaccine. There is lots of potential revenue at stake, so all parties are desperate to be the first to release a functioning vaccine. At the same time, we want to make sure the vaccine is safe to use and doesn't cause any severe adverse effects in the body. </p>
					<h3>Will there be a second wave?</h3>
					<p> It is too early to tell. We hope that if there is a second wave hospitals will be much better prepared to deal with the onslaught of cases.</p>
					<h3>If children are less likely to get sick because of the virus, is it safe for them to interact with other people without wearing a mask/go to school?</h3>
					<p> While children as less likely to get severely ill because of the virus, they can still be asymptomatic carriers, meaning they can still spread the virus to family members. Therefore, it is important for children to take the same precautions that adults do.</p>
