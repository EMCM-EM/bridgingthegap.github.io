				<h1> What is "The Mediastinum" </h1>
				<p> The mediastinum is located in the center of the chest between the two lungs and holds many vital organs of the body including the heart, the trachea, and the esophagus. </p>
				<img src="mediastinum.png" alt="image of the mediastinum">
				<h1>Why was this website created?</h1>
				<p>	This website was built in April 2020 during the COVID pandemic in an attempt to give accurate information about the pandemic. Its goal later morphed into providing a simplified understanding of various interesting and often misunderstood topics.</p>
				<p> This website aims to remain apolitical. </p>
				<h1> What are the components of the Website?</h1>
				<p> The site has two branches: Health and Takes. The "Health" branch provides simplified information of topics in healthcare. The "Takes" branch, short for "Quick Takes," includes more editorial-style pieces around a variety of subjects. </p>

				<h1>Other information:</h1>
				<p>This website does not attempt to treat or prescribe. It is not a replacement or a substititon for the advice and counsel of your personal physician.</p>


				<!--The rising death toll, misinformation, media sensationalization, and politicization of key facts created an environment where differentiating between correct, factual information and incorrect/misleading information became difficult. The use of social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter exacerbated the problem and false stories, false treatments, and blatantly untrue facts were able to masquerade through the collective conscience unimpeded. What ultimately resulted was general confusion over basic facts regarding the pandemic, the treatments, the presence or lack of a vaccine, information about personal protective equipment, the goals of self-quarantining, how testing should function, what the phrase "flatten the curve" meant, and most importantly - why the directives suggested by the scientific community were necessary.-->

				 <!--The amount of misinformation, the mass panic, the rising death toll, and the sensationalization via media headlines resulted in a perfect storm of misinformation, hysteria, and general mistrust of the people in power and the information they espoused. Incorrect information was promulgated by domestic and international leadership, the media, and by family and friends via social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter. What resulted was a general confusion over the basic facts regarding the pandemic, treatments, vaccines, masks, quarantine, the economy, and unemployment. What was lacking was a platform where factual information could be received without the sensationalization of the media. What was lacking was a source of information that was easy for the general public to understand. What was lacking was a place where the basic truths could be learned without political commentators and social media influencers spinning each new piece of information for their own personal or political gain. And thus, this website was created.</p> -->
