        <p>New Years - no matter when it occurs in your cultural tradition - is a marker of endings and new beginnings. It's not only the end to a calendar year, but also an end to the sorrows, obstacles, and difficulties experienced over a long year fraught with personal struggles. The new beginning is the the coming year. A year that will bring unforeseeable joys, individual victories, and accomplishments. Essentially, a new year day celebrations are celebrations of rekindled hope for a better future - a future where you truly are able to manifest the message from the last line of William Ernest Henley's poem, Invictus: "I'm the master of my fate; I'm the captain of my soul."</p>
        <p>The year prior forced us to experience moments where we had little-to-no control over our own lives. Be it from habits that we tried to quit, habits that we tried to build, outside forces that obliterated our resolve, our finances, and our morale, or from unforeseeable circumstances (eg. job loss, natural disasters, etc.). Ultimately, with the new year, we want an opportunity to exert more control over our own lives - and be successful in the endeavors that we put our minds to.</p>

        <p>It's easy to jump into a new year with excitement. Positivity is good, however we often forget that the joys and victories we desire in the coming year are inherently dependent on the work we put in to accomplish those same goals with a mixture of luck/chance/probability/a favorable universe/destiny/etc., which we will group into Variable X. When both those features align favorably, favorable results occur. When they don't - well, the previous year was example enough. Many celebrities and CEOs attribute their success solely on the amount of work they've put in. Yes, working hard is important and should not be neglected, but their success is also significantly impacted by Variable X. There is a tendency for a person who has experienced a success to attribute their success to his own hard work. At the same time, there is a tendency for a person who has experienced a failure to attribute his failure to external forces. This is known as "self-serving bias." We all do it consciously or unconsciously.</p>
        <p>I believe it is healthy no matter whether it's a success or failure to recognize and acknowledge the interplay of both one's personal effort and Variable X. As a result, if a failure results, it's important to reflect on how Variable X impacted the negative outcome, while acknowledging how one's efforts went awry. If a success occurs, it is similarly important to celebrate one's effort, while also acknowledging with gratitude the impact of Variable X.</p>
        <p>To give my own opinion for a second, I believe that Variable X often plays a much greater role on one's successes and failures than does one's effort. Simple things like - country of birth, birthday, place you grew up, family dynamic, genetics, etc. all play a significant role in determining successes and failures. The sum of all the factors that play into Variable X we can name as being a person's "Luck Score." This "Luck Score" is not binary, but a distribution of scores from 0 to n, where n is the maximum luck score possible (whatever that may be). It might seem odd to state that luck is a distribution. But random chance is a distribution! The probability of a coin being heads is 50%. This would mean that if a coin were to be flipped 100 times, heads would be present in 50 of those tosses. In reality, the number of heads may be 50, may be greater than 50, or may be less than 50. All the possible options are described by the normal distribution. The likelihood that a coin flipped 100 times would land heads all 100 times is highly unlikely - but not impossible (actual probability is 0.5^100 or 7.89x10^-29%)). Importantly, the "Luck Score" isn't a fixed probability distribution. Based on the event in question, the "Luck Score" may be high, average, or low.
				</p>
				<p> Take for example a person's goal to be a professional singer. For a regular person, the "Luck Score" is probably low. Not everyone can be a professional singer. But what if your dad was a record producer? Your "Luck Score" would be much much higher. It is way more easier to become a professional singer if you have the backing and contacts that your parentage would bring you. You were very lucky to have been born into that family and very lucky that you wanted to become a singer (If you wanted to be an investment banker rather than a singer, your "Luck Score" may resemble that of any other person). This does not mean hard work is unnecessary; you'd still have to put in the effort. But it would be much easier to produce a professional album given your family than if you were a regular person. A question that should arise at this point is arise at this point is, "Why are some regular people able to break into these super difficult industries?" The answer is simple: Variable X. Their "Luck Score" was higher at the particular moment they were discovered. Sure, they probably worked really hard and became a phenomenal singer. But many phenomenal singers aren't able to break into the industry and produce a professional album because they don't get the backing from Variable X. Ultimately, I believe every accomplishment and every failure is intrinsically dependent on Variable X. But work is important too.
				</p>
        <p>In simpler terms: <b>work positions us so that when favorable Variable X arises, success results.</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Work + Favorable Variable X = Success</li>
          <li>No Work + Favorable Variable X = Maybe Failure but Possible Success too</li>
          <li>No Work + Unfavorable Variable X = Failure</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>So, how does all this relate to New Years and New Years' resolutions?</p>
        <p><b>First,</b> it's important to recognize that achievements are most commonly achieved via a confluence of personal labor and Variable X. It's easy to jump into a new year with excitement and anticipation of all the potential successes in the future. Psychologic positivity is good, however it's important to understand the combined importance of work and Variable X.</p>
        <p><b>Second,</b> we should control what we can control. We are unable to exert influence on Variable X, but we are able to directly influence the amount of work we put in. Therefore, it is important to put in the work necessary to get to the point where our situation is ripe for Variable X to exert its influence. Some might think that the solution is to completely immerse yourself in the work. Pull all-nighters and 18 hour workdays. This is not the case. Binge working will only result in burnout. You'll be able to work for a week - maybe two. And then, your morale and your excitement will wane. The work you're doing will seem like a chore, and you will fall from your path. Instead, consistency is the solution. Decide how much work time is reasonable and then cut back the amount of time to something where you think it's almost too little. Thus, when a particularly terrible day arises and you feel like doing no work, you'll look at your plan and think, "I guess I can spend that amount of time working today," rather than, "I don't think I can work for that long today." This is a key difference.</p>
        <p><b>Third,</b> try to make specific goals with a measurable outcome. A goal of studying more or exercising more is just too vague to be meaningful. A better goal involves some specifics. For example, I would like to exercise at least 1 hour every other day before dinner. This is measurable and specific - you can measure 1 hour with a timer and it's specifically every other day before dinner. There! Good goal.</p>
        <p>  Let's work through a example. <i>One of my goals this year is to read more books.</i> Let's work on making this more specific and with a measurable outcome. <i>I will read 1 new book every month.</i> Better...but we can improve on this too: <i>I will read 1 new book every month. To accomplish this, I will spend 1 hour every evening after dinner reading on my Kindle.</i> The 1 hour time-frame is a reasonable goal, but we don't want this to become a chore, so let's cut back to make our goal more attainable: <i>I will read 1 new book every month. To accomplish this, I will spend at least 30 minutes every evening after dinner reading on my Kindle.</i> Now, even if I'm super tired after a long day, I'll look at that 30 minute time mark and think, "you know...I'm tired, but I can do this." Now, if I'm having a really good day, I might even read for 1.5 hours. That's ok! Even if I read for 1.5 hour on one day, the next day I still need to read 30 minutes. Consistency is better than binging.</p>
        <p>That's it! I hope this was helpful in creating a realistic New Years Resolution while also understanding the influence of Variable X in our ability to succeed or fail.</p>
