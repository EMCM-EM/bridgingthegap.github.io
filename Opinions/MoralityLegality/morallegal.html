  					<p>What is legal may or may not be moral and what is moral may or may not be legal. In our society, the ideas of legality and morality are so intertwined that we often believe that as long as we follow the law we are also doing what is morally right (ie. ethically good). In reality, legality and morality are disparate concepts that, like a Venn diagram, often overlap - but not always. The moments when these terms don't overlap are significantly important because they indicate a topic where either the law or our own morality must change. Let's first start with definitions.
            </p>
            <dl class="row">
              <dt class="col-sm-1">Legal:</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-11">Conforming to or permitted by law</dd>
              <dt class="col-sm-1">Moral:</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-11">Of or relating to principles of right and wrong behavior</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>These definitions introduce three new terms that we must define as well: "law," "right," and "wrong."
            </p>

            <dl class="row">
              <dt class="col-sm-1">Law:</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-11">a binding custom or practice of a community: a rule of conduct or action prescribed or formally recognized as binding or enforced by a controlling authority</dd>
              <dt class="col-sm-1">Right:</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-11">being in accordance with what is just, good, or proper</dd>
              <dt class="col-sm-1">Wrong:</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-11">something wrong, immoral, or unethical</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
            Funnily, defining these terms leads to a rabbit hole of more words whose meanings need to be defined. However, we will skip this step, partly because the task is fractalesque in nature (ie. kind of like a Russian nested-doll), and partly because the majority of us have a pretty decent understanding of "right" and "wrong." This is something taught to us by our parents, our religions, our schools, and our community. And therein lies the source of conflation. Both law and morality are given to us by an authority figure, usually, a figure whom we trust, respect, and believe. We are taught indirectly that there is no such thing as an immoral law - because the authority figure (whom we trust, respect, and believe) - created the law. And that authority figure could never create an immoral law! Right? So, from childhood, morality and legality become synonymous: What is legal is moral; what is not legal is not moral.
            </p>

            <p>
            Another way to say this is:
            </p>
            <dl class="row">
              <dt class="col-sm-1">Statement A:</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-11">If it is legal, then it is moral.</dd>
              <dt class="col-sm-1">Statement B:</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-11">If it is not legal then it is not moral.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
            Mathematicians who've studied logic would note that Statement B is the inverse of Statement A. They would also note that even if Statement A is assumed to be true, Statement B - the inverse - does not necessarily have to be true. Let's create two new statements to illustrate this point:
            </p>
            <dl class="row">
              <dt class="col-sm-1">Statement A:</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-11">If it rains, then the ground will be wet.</dd>
              <dt class="col-sm-1">Statement B:</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-11">If it does not rain, then the ground will not be wet.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
            At first glance, Statement B seems true. Why would the ground be wet if it has not rained? Well...maybe the ground has a sprinkler system? Maybe little children played with water guns on that ground? Maybe an old man hosed down the ground to soften it? There could be a million reasons the ground could be wet without it raining. Thus, even if Statement A is true, Statement B does not have to be true.
            </p>
            <p>
            Let's return to our discussion about legality and morality. Throughout our nation's history, many laws have been created to mimic the populace's morality. Theft is immoral. So, theft is illegal. Murder is immoral. So, murder is illegal. All that is not explicitly stated as illegal in our penal codes are thus moral.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, history reveals numerous examples of situations where legality did not equate with morality. Slavery was deemed legal until the 13th amendment to the US Constitution was ratified. Does that mean slavery was moral? No! Black men were not allowed to legally vote until the 15th amendment was ratified. Does that mean prohibiting individuals to vote based on race was moral? No! Women were not allowed to vote until the 19th amendment was ratified. Does that mean the prohibiting women to vote was moral? No! These are all prominent examples of when legality did not equate with morality.
            </p>
            <p>
            It could be argued that slavery, voting restrictions, etc. were legal because they were moral now they are immoral today because the law changed. This would suggest that the law influences our morality and not the other way around. If a law came out tomorrow that all families must abandon their first-born child. Does that mean, that is now a moral action? No. A better explanation is that our society's idea of what is moral changed over time and that change created an impetus for the law to change.
            </p>
            <p>
            What this means is that neither the law nor morality is fixed. Something that was moral yesterday may not be moral today. In fact, something that was moral in one situation may not be moral in another situation. Therefore, the law should not be the basis of morality, but a reflection of it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Stealing may be illegal and immoral in most scenarios. But is stealing an apple from a street vendor to feed your starving child immoral? Maybe not. The possession and use of any drug X might be illegal? But if that drug is providing you relief from debilitating psychiatric ailments and chronic pain is it immoral? Concealing a "criminal" from arrest may be illegal? But is it immoral to provide refuge to peaceful protestors shot with rubber bullets and teargas because they violated curfew?
            </p>
            <p>
            In most of these scenarios, legality and morality don't always align perfectly. That means that either the law is wrong or our idea of what is moral is wrong. A Venn-Diagram with circles that do not exactly overlap means that either there is a law that is immoral or that our conception of morality is incorrect. In either case, the only solution is the change of either the law or our conception of what is right/wrong.

            <p>
            Lawrence Kohlberg created his famous Stages of Moral Development to describe the arc that humans take as they grow older. Look his paper up for a much more detailed explanation. In short, Kohlberg created 10 hypothetical moral dilemmas. He then posed these dilemmas to participants of different ages and recorded their responses. Finally, he grouped the responses into different stages which he categorized as below. He found that the younger the individual, the lower the stage of development and that the stages must be ascended in order.
            </p>
            <div class="kohlberg">
              <p>
              <span style ="font-weight: bold;">Stage 1:</span> Orientation to obedience and punishment.
              The individual is focussed on avoiding punishment. Thus, the consequences for actions determine right and wrong
              </p>
              <p>
              <span style ="font-weight: bold;"> Stage 2:</span> Orientation to self-interest.
              The individual is focussed on personal gain and loss. Thus, satisfaction of one's own needs defines what is good.
              </p>
              <p>
              <span style ="font-weight: bold;">Stage 3:</span> Orientation to Social Norms
              The individual is focussed on pleasing others. Thus, what others approve of is good.
              </p>
              <p>
              <span style ="font-weight: bold;">Stage 4:</span> Orientation to law and order
              The individual is focussed on blindly accepting the laws of society. Thus, maintaining law and order/doing one's duty is good.
              </p>
              <p>
              <span style ="font-weight: bold;">Stage 5:</span> Orientation to the social-contract
              Laws are social contracts, not rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed.
              </p>
              <p>
              <span style ="font-weight: bold;">Stage 6:</span> Orientation towards a Universal-Ethical-Principle
              Laws are valid if they are grounded in justice. Thus, right and wrong are matters of individual philosophy, and morality is determined by the individual's own conscience regardless of the law.
